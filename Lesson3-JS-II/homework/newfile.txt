1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  
Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `for`
	* `&&`, `||`, `!`
	* Arrays
The 'for' loop is a way to make something go over and over again. Everytime the forloop runs,
it creates a different value, so it is essentially adding on itself until it reaches a certain
value. Once it reaches that value, the loop stops.

'&&' is JavaScript's way of identifying that two conditions must be met. For example, in order to 
have ice cream tonight for desert, you must eat chicken && corn. It cannot be one or the other.
However, || identifies that the requirements are one or the other. Refrencing the previous example,
in order to have ice cream for desert, chicken || corn must be eaten. As long as one of the conditions
are met, the value will be true. Finally, ! indicates "not". If you want ice cream for dinner, chicken !corn must
be eaten (You must eat your chicken, but you cannot eat your corn).

Arrays are a way of keeping multiple values within a single variable. For example, if someone had multiple phone numbers,
you can use an array to keep track of all the phone numbers a person has. When you access that array, it will bring up all 
the phone numbers stored within.
