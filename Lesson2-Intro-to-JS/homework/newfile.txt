explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. 
Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.

	* Variables
	* Strings
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
	* `if` statements
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

A Variable is something that can be changed. If you want to make a sandwhich, a Variable
of the sandwhich can be the kind of meat, to type of bread. It can be changed to make
a different sandwhich.

Strings are lines of text. Each line of words on the page of a favorite book are Strings
within that book.

Functions are a way of writing instructions without having to write them over and over. 
A function an change depending on what variable is used. When you change the variable (arguemnt),
the outcome (return) is changed as well.

'if' statements are instructions that are dependent on a certain input (or event). 
For example. 'if' your room is clean, you can play. If not (else), you must clean
your room.

Boolean values mean simply yes (true) or no (false). There is no in between. In the words
of Katy Perry, you're either yes or you're no, your hot or you're cold, you're in or your out,
you're up or your down.
